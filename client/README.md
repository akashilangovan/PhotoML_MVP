To run Electron client in dev mode:

**npm install**

**npm start**

To package Electron Client:

**npx electron-packager . MyApp --platform=mas --arch=x64**

**npx electron-builder**

Create .env file in client directory with aws credentials.
Creds are in the same format as I sent on slack earlier.
